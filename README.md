Project:   
Bus Transportation Management System

Project Descriptions:   
This project will mainly foucus on manging the inflow and organization of data of individuals and locations.\
Individuals traveling on coach buses will have their location taken in. This project came into fruition due to traveling back to my city and observing the operater just reciting the stops as if he did not have anything that would display the the stops. 

Summary:  
I am building a managmenet system where individual are given random   location stop point so the conductor has an overview of where to stop for those certain individual. I made a list of the stops with import   random helping assigning individuals city stops. Next I will be integrating Stack and Queue exclusivly for individual queueing in as well as reomve those who've been drop off at their final destination.

Report:  
Intitive - Random was implied for randomizing stops to each individual, which ranges from//
stop 1 to 5. The amount of individual will be soley base on the capacity of the bus, which in this case is up to 60 spots to be occupide. 


Implemeation of data structure/ Algorithm stacks will ensure that: 
1) Stops will be push into the stack
2) Stops will be pop in reverse order, to simulate the stopping of the bus at each loaction 
3) Simultaneously, it will be cheking on the status of the list 

Implementation of data structure/Algorithm of a Queue will ensure that: 
1) Individuals will ben enqueue into the queue when they are assigned a stop 
2) Individuals will be dequeue form the queue when they board the bus or get off at their stop
3) Simutlaneously check on the status of the list

Implemetation of data structure/Algorithm for a Array for both Stack and Queue: 
1) Will store the list of stops 
2) Internal storage for both stack and queue

Random Algorithm: 
1) Will be use to gernerate indices for individualStopsList array, which in this case will assign randomly stops to individuals. 

Future Plans: 
I plan to add a scanning device for scanning names of each individual as well as a motion sensor to provide a more realiable count of individual coming in or out of certain spots. Peraphs this will become a device the work on sending warning when to people that have forgotten thing in their car.
